## ProjetFinal
This is the final project for our JAVA formation. Our theme is the transport. So we decide to do a web application for car's renting. Our idea is to facilitate the use of the application for both the customer and the employees. For the frontend, we are using Angular. We create the front for the Reservation's part and for the administrator of the company.
